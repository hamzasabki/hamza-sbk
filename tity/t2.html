                    Hello, my name is Hamza. This is my website. I built over the holiday. In fact, it was built in two days to apply everything I learned about programming in the field of web development. Perhaps the site will not be responsive to some screens because I did not pay attention to this, the important thing is, welcome to my site, perhaps it is not perfect, but this is because I was on another larger project. This is my rose site I grew from the seeds that I planted. I challenged myself this summer and developed from them. I achieved many goals, and this is what matters to me.
I don't have much to say. my work it will talk...
